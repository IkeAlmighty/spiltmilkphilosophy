                    <b>It can be difficult</b> to nail down exactly what philosophy is. The word itself comes from Pythagoras, and translates into modern english as “the love of wisdom”. But that does nothing to clear up the ambiguity. It’s most helpful to think of philosophy as an attempt to understand the fundamental questions of the universe and existing, and to attempt to answer these questions through argument and reason. As an academic pursuit, philosophy covers a substantial number of sub-disciplines which are usually divided into four categories, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Value Theory, and Logic.

                    <b>Metaphysics </b>is the study of the nature of existence and reality. To put it simply, metaphysics asks what ultimately exists, and what it’s fundamental nature is. This branch deals with questions you may associate with being very high, or staying awake far too late, such as “what if we are all actually being manipulated by a demon so that we can’t tell the real from the fake?” (a real question DesCartes asks) and “Is the physical or the mental more real?”. But rather than wild speculation, classical metaphysics tries to answer these questions by breaking them down into parts and using reason to find an answer.

                <p>
                    <b>Epistemology </b>is the study of knowledge. It deals with questions such as “How we can know anything” and “What does it mean to know something.” At its most basic Epistemology is an attempt to answer what we can and cannot know, how we can be sure our beliefs are correct, and where the justification for knowledge comes from. Is knowledge inherent and discovered, or is it created? These questions and topics all are deeply important to the study of philosophy as a whole, since philosophy’s goal is to discover true knowledge about our existence and the realm in which we exist.

                    <b>Value Theory </b>is the study of value, specifically, what ought to be valued and how we can measure the goodness of anything. It’s usually broken down into two or three subcategories, those being Ethics, Aesthetics, and sometimes Political Philosophy. Ethics is concerned with how we should live our lives, what gives something ethical value, and whether intention, consequence, or habit are more important. Aesthetics deals with the nature of beauty, or what gives something aesthetic value, or what we should consider when making the judgement that something is “beautiful”. Finally, political philosophy deals with how political life is and ought to be constructed, and what makes something valuable in the political sphere of human life.

                <p>
                    <b>Logic </b>is the final category we will discuss today, and is a fundamental part of philosophy. Logic is the means by which an argument is evaluated and it’s success measured. Since all of philosophy is the process of making arguments for certain philosophic positions, it stands to reason that we evaluated these arguments via logic. Logic is, as with all the subjects above, extensive and complex, but it can be best broken down into measuring the validity of two types of arguments, deductive and inductive, and then deciding whether they are sound or unsound, and cogent or uncogent respectively. We will discuss the details of logical evaluation further in a later post.

                    Philosophy is a massive field dealing with a plethora of topics, this list makes up the classical categories of philosophical discussion. And a discussion it has been. Philosophy has, thus far, been a 2,600 year pursuit, an argument across millennium about the nature of human existence and reality, and an attempt to better understand ourselves, our minds, and our world.
